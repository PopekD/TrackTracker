Cross-Platform Mobile Application to track desired train in FInland.

//Made with React-Native

//Source code -> Master Branch

//Description: Track your train in real-time. Built using React-Native, this app allows you to follow the location of a specific train on both iOS and Android devices. Using the Apollo-Client to fetch data from Digitraffic's REST API v1 and v2 (GraphQL), I have created an interactive map that displays the location of your train in real-time using Map Marker, so you'll always know when your train will arrive.

App is devided in 2 sectors, Trains with Numbers and Commuter Trains. Both can be Tracked but with The Commuter Trains it requires a little more afford.

DigTrafic API documentation: https://www.digitraffic.fi/rautatieliikenne/
